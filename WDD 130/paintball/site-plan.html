      <h3>What is this Site?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Why will people come to this site?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        People will come to this site as it allows a user not only to simply sign up for an event 
        (though they could certainly do so), but also to determine how they could 
        create their own paintball experience and what equipment and space they would need 
        to rent or buy. All of this will be determinable from this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What questions will visitors expect this site to answer for them?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        People will come to this site to plan for an active day of paintballing. 
        They will use this site both to see what to expect from a day of paintballing, 
        as well as to plan and coordinate their own future experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on this site?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        While paintballing is the primary goal, visitors can also use this site to 
        research any equipment needed to plan their own activity, as well as 
        information on how to perform paintball activities in a typical format.

      <h3>Using this Site</h3>
      <p>
        <b>What information is necessary to complete any actions this site offers?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is necessary to know beforehand what kind of event the visitor wishes to create. 
        Do they want a small event with close friends? A group activity with members of a 
        social circle? A community activity for the whole neighborhood? 
        The desired scale, more than anything else, is needed when using this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why will visitors come to this site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        While other sites provide purchasable planning, this site will also provide information 
        on creating one's own paintballing experience, which would generate higher traffic and 
        potentionally increasing its visiblity to those who are willing to spend for 
        such an experience.
